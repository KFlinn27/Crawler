# Crawler

## Description

Crawler is a simple game but can be heavily expanded on. Currently, as the player, you must try to get to a certain position on a board, navigating through enemies.
Reaching the marked position will "win" the game. Allowing an enemy to make contact with you results in a loss.

## Technologies

The program is a Java CLI application. In the future I may turn it into a full stack project but currently it is my practice tool for the Java language.

## Creation Reason

I felt the need to play with a larger scope of thoughts than what happens with business-logic. Trying to model AI and the interactions between that AI and the player
was a challenge that I wanted to embark on. I also have played video games my whole life, being able to create one was a no brainer. This project has been so
rewarding, I will never forget the rush I had at 11PM after I got multiple enemy spawns working in addition to a serviceable algorithm to hunt me and I played a game
requiring all my remaining brain power to out-smart my own logic.

## Goals for future

* Make multiple "layouts" that a user can choose to play through
* Make multiple difficulties for each layout
* Create a combat system so enemy interaction isn't just death
* Create more advanced AI but limit it to only work through having line of sight to the player
